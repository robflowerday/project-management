# project-management
The purpose of this repo is to give an indication to the overall plan.

The 2 main repos I plan to create are a machine learning agent that uses reinforement learning that is capable of beating initially unknown opponents and to build an algorithmic trading bot that is capable of determining winning trading strategies, executing its own trades and showing and account useful description of its trades with it's reasoning.

To achieve these aims I believe I will need to learn reinforcement-learning, how to build a front end webpage, how to host this web-page, how to program the back-end and how to link the two.

I intend to build the back-end of my web-apps using Django and the front-end using React.

I therefore must
- Learn Django
- Learn React
- Learn reinforcement-learning

In order to do this I will create a number of simpler applications
- Tic-tac-toe
- Draughts
- Chess

I currently intend to bulid a front end for each mini-app in React, then a back-end in Django, then create a reinforcement-learning agent that is capable of consistantly beating me and others in each game before moving onto the above more complicated projects.
